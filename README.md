# Difference Between Arrays and ArrayLists in Java

In Java, arrays and ArrayLists are used to store data, but they work differently.

- Arrays are fixed in size and use a simple structure.
- ArrayLists are flexible and can grow or shrink during the program.

This project demonstrates those differences using Java code and comments.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated:
- Creating and using arrays
- Creating and using ArrayLists
- Adding, accessing, and removing values
- Descriptive comments for each part

## How to Run:
Open the file in VS Code or your Java IDE. Run the `DifferenceArraysArrayLists` class and follow the output.
